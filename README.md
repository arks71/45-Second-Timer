# 45-Second-Timer
A 45 second timer for roller hockey rinks based on the Sparkfun Large Digit Driver &amp; Arduino

There are a number of variants depending on how you want to use the timer.

1) Standard alone version using an analog button keypad
2) Standard alone version using a digital button keypad
3) Wireless version using a nrf24l01 chipset
4) Wireless version using a micro:bit for wireless comms

These are in the subfolders
1) 45SecondTimer-StandaloneAnalog
2) 45SecondTimer-StandaloneDigital
3) ReceiverWithNRF24L01
4) ReceiverWithMicrobit

Corresponding circuit diagrams are now in the subfolders.

For the wireless versions - you'll either need a second Arduino with a nrf24l01 chip, or one or more micro:bits running my 'wearable' timer software
